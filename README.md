# rocoto-feedstock

A conda recipe for the [Rocoto](https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/rocoto) workflow manager.

To build and upload a package to anaconda.org:

- Clone this repo on an `aarch64` or `x86_64` Linux system. The built package will match the system architecture.
- Run `./build`.
- If prompted, enter your anaconda.org credentials for package upload.
- When finished, you may remove the `conda` directory to reclaim disk space.
- Repeat, if necessary, for another architecture.
